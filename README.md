# Save Manager for Undertale and Deltarune

I always enjoy playing through various UNDERTALE and deltarune boss fights and minigames, like Sans, Jevil, Roaring Knight or Lightners Live.
Unfortunately, deltarune only supports 3 SAVE slots per chapter, UNDERTALE just one. This graphical tool helps with selecting save files,
backing them up and launching the game.

## Install

TBA.

## Build

To build the program yourself, see [`BUILD.md`](./BUILD.md).
